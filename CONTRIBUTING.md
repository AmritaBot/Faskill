5. Create a Pull Request

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure your PR has a clear description explaining what changes were made and why
- Follow the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) Python code style
- Add necessary tests
- Make sure all tests pass
- Update documentation (if needed)
- If the PR resolves an issue, reference it in the PR (e.g. `Fixes #123`)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests for Functional Changes

When contributing code that introduces new functionality or modifies existing functionality, you are required to include corresponding unit tests:

- **New Features**: All new features must include comprehensive unit tests covering both basic functionality and edge cases
- **Bug Fixes**: Each bug fix must include regression tests that reproduce the reported issue and verify the fix
- **Breaking Changes**: Breaking changes must include tests demonstrating the new behavior and verifying that the change works as intended

### Test Quality Standards

- Write tests that are clear, focused, and easy to understand
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Include both positive and negative test cases where applicable
- Test error conditions and boundary values
- Follow the existing test patterns in the codebase

### Running Tests

Before submitting your PR, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
# Run all tests (use python3 as specified in project configuration)
uv run pytest tests/
```

## Development Process

### Code Style

- Use the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) Python code style
- Add type hints
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Use ruff for code formatting

Before submitting a PR, it's recommended to run:

```bash
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
```

### Documentation

- Update relevant documentation in the `docs/` directory
- Add examples for new features
- Keep documentation synchronized with code
- Both English and Chinese documentation should be updated simultaneously

## Code Contribution Examples

### Adding New Features

1. Create a new module in `src/faskill/` or extend existing modules
2. Add type definitions to `types.py` (if needed)
3. Implement the feature ensuring it follows existing code style
4. Add unit tests
5. Update documentation (both English and Chinese)

### Fixing Bugs

1. Identify the problem
2. Create a test case to verify the issue
3. Fix the issue
4. Ensure all tests pass

### Improving Documentation
